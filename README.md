Modules

Each of the following modules is in separate directory in project with all their related files.

- decoder: Module for decoding signals

- demux: Demultiplexer module.

- fulladder: Full adder module.

- gcd_: Module for finding the greatest common divisor

- jk: Module related to JK flip-flops.

- lcm: Module for finding the least common multiple.

- mux: Multiplexer module.

- seq: Module related to sequential logic (detection of 1011 sequence


Dependencies To run the code in this repository

The following dependencies are required:

- GHDL
GHDL is the compiler for VHDL code. To install this : * For Linux Use this Command : sudo <package manager> install ghdl E.g. sudo apt install ghdl , sudo yum install ghdl * For Windows Follow the guide on GHDL github repo

- GTK-WAVE
GTK-WAVE is the program for viewing the input output waveforms. * For Linux Use the command : sudo <package-manager> install gtkwave E.g sudo apt install gtkwave * For Windows : Follow the instructions on the [GTKwave website] (https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net)

- How To Run
Each module is in it's own folder and includes a test bench file with the naming convention name_tb.vhdl. Use these test benches to run and test the corresponding modules. The Makefile in the respective directories contain the commands to compile and run the modules and then export a waveform file.
